To break the captchas with CNN, following steps are taken
1. Downloading a set of images.
2. Labeling and annotating your images for training.
3. Training a CNN on your custom dataset.
4. Evaluating and testing the trained CNN.

1.To automatically fetch new captcha images and save them to disk we use download_images.py , 
requests python package is needed, to install it ,insert following command:

$pip install requests

to run download_images.py  insert following command


$python download_images.py --output downloads



2.we can efficiently create out own dataset using openCV image processing techniques, to do it run annotate.py 

$python annotate.py --input downloads --annot dataset

when digits are shown corresponding key should be pressed

3.Training the captcha Breaker,run

$ train_model.py

4. to test the captcha Breaker

$python test_model.py --input downloads --model output/lenet.hdf5
